This is a [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that stores player information in an external [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for other systems to utilise, such as statistics calculation.

This mod depends on [my Events mod](https://github.com/viral32111/events) for mixin callbacks.
